    padding: 6px 12px;" href="https://github.com/tanaypratap/ama/issues/new">Open an Issue</button> and write your question.

## Will all questions be answered?

I'll try my best but understand that I have a full time job and I'm doing this to help as many people as possible. But I have my limits. Any time I spend answering questions is the time I am taking away from my personal learning or my beautiful family.
In short, be patient and empathetic. And you can help!

## How can I help?

There are many ways you can help me do this better:
1. **Search before** raising an issue. See if the question you have is already there or not.
2. **Vote on questions** you like or want to be answered first. Likes or any positive emoji will act as a vote.
3. **Most important!** Ask generic questions, which would be helpful to a lot more people. I'll spend most time on questions which shows potential.

## How will I know when my question is answered?
