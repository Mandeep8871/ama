# Ask Me Anything

## How to do it?

The repo is **[github.com/tanaypratap/ama](https://github.com/tanaypratap/ama)**

Just [Open an Issue](https://github.com/tanaypratap/ama/issues/new) and write your question.

## What kind of questions can be asked?

Anything means anything. 
* Tech 
* Career choices 
* Money, 
* Life choices, 
* Philosophy. 

Anything I can help you with or picques your interest.

Keep in mind that it should **not be unethical**.

It should **not be a consulting arrangement**. If you're looking for a consultant ping me on [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/tpratap/).

**Not be a stackoverflow question**. You are getting an error in a program and you need me to look into it. Please ask such questions on 
* [stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/), if it's a general programming question.

* or [metastartup-fb group](https://www.facebook.com/groups/361737054599889/), if it's a question related to my youtube video courses,

* or [web developers family group](https://www.facebook.com/groups/akshaysaini.in/), if it's a general web dev related question
where I routinely answer such questions.

## Will all questions be answered?

I'll try my best but understand that I have a full time job and I'm doing this to help as many people as possible. But I have my limits. Any time I spend answering questions is the time I am taking away from my personal learning or my beautiful family.
In short, be patient and empathetic. And you can help!

## How can I help?

There are many ways you can help me do this better:
1. **Search before** raising an issue. See if the question you have is already there or not.
2. **Vote on questions** you like or want to be answered first. Likes or any positive emoji will act as a vote.
3. **Most important!** Ask generic questions, which would be helpful to a lot more people. I'll spend most time on questions which shows potential.
